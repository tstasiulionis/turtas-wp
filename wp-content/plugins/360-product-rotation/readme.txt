== Description ==
####Demo####
An example is worth 1000s words: [View Online Demo](https://www.yofla.com/3d-rotate/wordpress-integration-demo/)

####Works in 3 steps ####
1. Grab this [sample archive](https://www.yofla.com/3d-rotate/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/yofla/demo_backpack.zip) or shoot your own [product images](https://www.yofla.com/3d-rotate/support/manuals/how-to-photograph-a-product-for-360-degree-product-photography/)
2. Upload the archive in the WP Admin&raquo; Media&raquo;360 Views
3. Copy and paste the short code into any page or post

If you want to have more control over your 360&deg; view, you can use the [online 360 view creator](https://www.yofla.com/3d-rotate/creator/?utm_source=wp_plugin&utm_medium=wordpress.org) to generate your 360° product view.


####Features####
* Full 360° view

== Installation ==
* Install 360 Product Rotation Plugin by installing from your Wordpress Admin area
* Activate the module via the Plugins page in your Wordpress Admin area
* Upload the archive with images in WP Admin&raquo; Media&raquo;360 View
* Use a shortcode to embed:

[360 width="100%" height="375px" src="yofla360/weddingring"]

* **src** is the product folder name under *wp-content/uploads*. (this is generated for you)
* **width** is your desired width in px or % (optional parameter, defaults to 500px)
* **height** is your desired height in px or % (optional parameter, defaults to 375px)
